# DreamDay

Dream Day is a project created by the students of infoShare Academy. Our application utilizes technologies such as React, Remix + Vite, TypeScript and JavaScript, Firebase, and Cloudflare. For styling, we used tailwind.css and shadcn/ui components.

## Overview

Dream Day is a web application designed to help users organize weddings, receptions, and accompanying events such as bachelorette or bachelor parties. It also facilitates easy communication with invited guests.  
Users can create an event on their account and, through a form, add detailed information about location, date, and more. Each event has its own unique ID, automatic countdown, and the ability to create a guest list and budget.  
Each guest receives a unique identification code, making it easy to send surveys regarding RSVP, dietary preferences, transportation, and accommodation needs.  
Responses from invited guests are sent to the database and automatically loaded into the guest list table created by the user.  
The event budget allows for adding individual items and their costs, and multiple budgets can be created for a single event.

## Features

- **Create a personal account**: registration, login;
- **Create main events**: date, time, wedding venue, reception, with the option to delete the event;
- **Create accompanying events**: such as bachelorette or bachelor parties;
- **Create a guest list**: for the event â€“ add guests, remove them, update preferences;

<!--# Welcome to Remix + Vite!

ðŸ“– See the [Remix docs](https://remix.run/docs) and the [Remix Vite docs](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/future/vite) for details on supported features.

## Development

Run the Vite dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`
